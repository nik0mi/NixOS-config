# Linux Retroism | Quickshell Frontend

Before going into details:

I must point out the fact that this is my first time using Qt/QML/Quickshell for
a project like this.

I will likely update and refactor the quickshell project to improve things with time, as
the initial versions may not follow best practices for design or readability.

## Style Variants

You can add your own color-schemes in the `Config.qml` file, they will be updated
and added automatically to the theme switcher UI.

Various other settings can be changed/set by editing the `settings.json` file; although
those values can also be changed using the settings GUI.

> I am planning on making a GUI for creating and adding your own themes.
